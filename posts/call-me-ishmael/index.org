* Where am I?

This is my *brand* new blog, problems with my past hosting service, a nauseating CMS (wordpress) and a desire to write my rants in the beautiful org-mode led me to creating this site.

* What's it for?

What's any blog for really?

Mostly I wanted a method of informally discussing my current projects and interests and possibly write a tutorial or two as well.
